4. **Multi-environment**: Support for different Python versions and Node.js versions
5. **Docker Integration**: Test Docker builds and container functionality
6. **Security Scanning**: Basic dependency vulnerability scanning

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow file created in .github/workflows/
- [ ] Successful builds on push and pull request events
- [ ] Automated test execution with coverage reporting
- [ ] Linting passes for both Python and JavaScript code
- [ ] Docker build verification
- [ ] Failed builds block PR merging
- [ ] Build status badges in README

## Technical Specifications
- Use latest stable Python (3.11+) and Node.js (18+)
